        <item>Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of causing death, or with the
intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, or with the knowledge
that he is likely by such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable homicide.\nIllustrations:\n\n1. A lays sticks and turf over a pit, with the intention of thereby causing death, or with
the knowledge that death is likely to be thereby caused. Z, believing the ground to
be firm, treads on it, falls in and is killed. A has committed the offence of culpable
homicide.\n\n
2. A knows Z to be behind a bush. B does not know it. A, intending to cause, or
knowing it to be likely to cause Z ’death, induces B to fire at the bush. B fires and
kills Z. Here B may be guilty of no offence; but A has committed the offence of
culpable homicide.\n\n
3.A, by shooting at a fowl with intent to kill and steal it, kills B, who is behind a bush;
A not knowing that he was there. Here, although A was doing an unlawful act, he
was not guilty of culpable homicide, as he did not intend to kill B or to cause death
by doing an act that he knew was likely to cause death.\n\n
</item>
        <item>Except in the cases herein after excepted, culpable homicide is murder —\n\n
1. If the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death\n\n
2. If it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to
be likely to cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused.\n\n
3. If it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person and the bodily
injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause
death.\n\n
4. If the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must,
in all probability, cause death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and
commits such act without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such
injury as aforesaid.\n\n
Illustrations:\n\n
1. A shoots Z with the intention of killing him. Z dies in consequence. A commits murder.\n\n
2. A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely to cause his
death, strikes him with the intention of causing bodily injury. Z dies in consequence of
the blow. A is guilty of murder, although the blow might not have been sufficient in the
ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health.
But if A, not knowing that Z is labouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as
would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of health,
here A, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did
not intend to cause death, or such bodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature
would cause death.\n\n
3. A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cause the death of a
man in the ordinary course of nature. Z dies in consequence. Here A is guilty of
murder, although he may not have intended to cause Z ’death.\n\n
4. A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one of
them. A is guilty of murder, although he may not have had a premeditated design to
kill any particular individual.</item>
        <item>1. Where the death of a woman is caused by any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise
than under normal circumstances within seven years of her marriage and it is shown
that soon before her death she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband
or any relative of her husband for, or in connection with, any demand for dowry, such
death shall be called “dowry death”, and such husband or relative shall be deemed to
have caused her death.\n\n
 Explanations:\n\n
1. For the purposes of this sub-section, “dowry” shall have the same meaning as in
section 2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 (28 of 1961)\n\n
2. Whoever commits dowry death shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which
shall not be less than seven years but which may extend to imprisonment for life.
\n\n
</item>
        <item>If any person commits suicide, whoever abets the commission of such suicide, shall be
punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years,
and shall also be liable to fine.</item>
        <item>Whoever does any act under such circumstances, that if he thereby caused death he
would be guilty of culpable homicide, and does by such act cause the death of a quick
unborn child, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which
may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.\n\n
Illustrations:\n\n
1. A, knowing that he is likely to cause the death of a pregnant woman, does an act
which, if it caused the death of the woman, would amount to culpable homicide. The
woman is injured, but does not die; but the death of an unborn quick child with which
she is pregnant is thereby caused. A is guilty of the offence defined in this section.
\n\n</item>
        <item>The following kinds of hurt only are designated as “grievous”:\n\n
1. Emasculation.\n\n
2. Permanent privation of the sight of either eye.\n\n
3. Permanent privation of the hearing of either ear.\n\n
4. Privation of any member or joint.\n\n
5. Destruction or permanent impairing of the powers of any member or joint.\n\n
6. Permanent disfiguration of the head or face.\n\n
7. Fracture or dislocation of a bone or tooth.\n\n
8. Any hurt which endangers life or which causes the sufferer to be during the space of
twenty days in severe bodily pain, or unable to follow his ordinary pursuits.\n\n
</item>
        <item>Whoever voluntarily causes hurt, if the hurt which he intends to cause or knows himself to
be likely to cause is grievous hurt, and if the hurt which he causes is grievous hurt, is said
“voluntarily to cause grievous hurt”.\n\n
Explanations:\n\n
1. A person is not said voluntarily to cause grievous hurt except when he both causes
grievous hurt and intends or knows himself to be likely to cause grievous hurt. But he
is said voluntarily to cause grievous hurt, if intending or knowing himself to be likely to
cause grievous hurt of one kind, he actually causes grievous hurt of another kind.\n\n
Illustrations\n\n
1. A, intending of knowing himself to be likely permanently to disfigure Z ’face, gives Z a
blow which does not permanently disfigure Z ’face, but which causes Z to suffer
severe bodily pain for the space of twenty days. A has voluntarily caused grievous
hurt.\n\n
</item>
        <item>Whoever, except in the case provided for by section 334, voluntarily causes hurt, shall be
punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to one year,
or with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees, or with both.</item>
        <item>Whoever voluntarily obstructs any person so as to prevent that person from proceeding in
any direction in which that person has a right to proceed, is said wrongfully to restrain that
person.
Exceptions:\n\n
1. The obstruction of a private way over land or water which a person in good faith
believes himself to have a lawful right to obstruct, is not an offence within the
meaning of this section.\n\n
Illustrations\n\n
1. A obstructs a path along which Z has a right to pass. A not believing in good faith that
he has a right to stop the path. Z is thereby prevented from passing. A wrongfully
restrains Z.</item>
        <item>Whoever wrongfully restrains any person in such a manner as to prevent that person from
proceeding beyond certain circumscribing limits, is said “wrongfully to confine” that person.\n\n
Illustrations:\n\n
1. A causes Z to go within a walled space, and locks Z. Z is thus prevented from
proceeding in any direction beyond the circumscribing line of wall. A wrongfully
confines z.\n\n
2. A places men with firearms at the outlets of a building, and tells Z that they will fire at
Z if Z attempts leave the building. A wrongfully confines Z.
</item>
        <item>Whoever wrongfully confines any person in such manner as to indicate an intention that
the confinement of such person may not be known to any person interested in the person
so confined, or to any public servant, or that the place of such confinement may not be
known to or discovered by any such person or public servant as here in before mentioned,
shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to
two years in addition to any other punishment to which he may be liable for such wrongful
confinement.</item>
        <item>Whoever wrongfully confines any person for the purpose of extorting from the person
confined, or from any person interested in the person confined, any property or valuable
security or of constraining the person confined or any person interested in such person to
do anything illegal or to give any information which may facilitate the commission of an
offence, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may
extend to three years, and shall also be liable to fine.
</item>
        <item>A person is said to use force to another if he causes motion, change of motion, or
cessation of motion to that other, or if he causes to any substance such motion, or change
of motion, or cessation of motion as brings that substance into contact with any part of that
other ’body, or with anything which that other is wearing or carrying, or with anything so
situated that such contact affects that other ’sense of feeling;
Provided that the person causing the motion, or change of motion, or cessation of motion,
causes that motion, change of motion, or cessation of motion in one of the three ways
hereinafter described:\n\n
1. By his own bodily power.\n\n
2. By disposing any substance in such a manner that the motion or change or cessation
of motion takes place without any further act on his part, or on the part of any other
person.\n\n
3. By inducing any animal to move, to change its motion, or to cease to move.</item>
        <item>Whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any person otherwise than on grave and
sudden provocation given by that person, shall be punished with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to three months, or with fine which may extend to
five hundred rupees, or with both.\n\n
Explanations:-\n\n
1. Grave and sudden provocation will not mitigate the punishment for an offence under
this section, if the provocation is sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an
excuse for the offence.\n\n
2. if the provocation is given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public
servant, in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant\n\n
3. if the provocation is given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of
private defence.\n\n
Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to mitigate the offence, is a
question of fact.</item>
        <item>1. A man committing any of the following acts—\n\n
1. physical contact and advances involving unwelcome and explicit sexual
overtures.\n\n
a. a demand or request for sexual favours.\n\n

c. making sexually coloured remarks, shall be guilty of the offence of sexual
harassment.\n\n

sub-section (1) shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term which may
extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.\n\n
3. Any man who commits the offence specified in clause (iv) of sub-section (1) shall be
punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to one
year, or with fine, or with both.\n\n

</item>
        <item>Any man who assaults or uses criminal force to any woman or abets such act with the
intention of disrobing or compelling her to be naked, shall be punished with imprisonment
of either description for a term which shall not be less than three years but which may
extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.\n\n

by the perpetrator or by any other person at the behest of the perpetrator or disseminates
such image shall be punished on first conviction with imprisonment of either description for
a term which shall not be less than one year, but which may extend to three years, and
shall also be liable to fine, and be punished on a second or subsequent conviction, with
imprisonment of either description for a term which shall not be less than three years, but
which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.\n\n
Explanations:-\n\n

not of a kind ordinarily done in public.\n\n
2. Where the victim consents to the capture of the images or any act, but not to their

dissemination shall be considered an offence under this section.\n\n
 Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013</item>
        <item>Any man who—\n\n
1. Follows a woman and contacts, or attempts to contact such woman to foster personal
interaction repeatedly despite a clear indication of disinterest by such woman.\n\n
2. Monitors the use by a woman of the internet, email or any other form of electronic
communication.\n\n

crime by the State.\n\n
2. It was pursued under any law or to comply with any condition or requirement imposed

imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, and shall
also be liable to fine; and be punished on a second or subsequent conviction, with
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to five years, and shall
also be liable to fine.\n\n
